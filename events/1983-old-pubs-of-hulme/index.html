      <p>Different people from Hulme tell us about the old pubs in a publication by Bob Potts in 1983.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having lived in the district all my life since 1900, I have a good knowledge of Hulme pubs. Some early memories rel­ate to street life in Hulme, such as the frequently seen and heard barrel organs, which had the children dancing in the streets. There was also a dancing bear outside the pubs on Chester Road, which per­formed for our pennies. The bear was owned by an old Italian man. On Egerton Street, off Chester Road, the Egerton Inn kept a champion talking parrot in a cage on the bar­counter. People went in there for a gill and a gab to the parrot. Not surprisingly this pub was nick-named the Birdcage.</p>
