      <p>Developed under the Hulme City Challenge programme, Homes for Change was accepted as one of the social housing developers in Hulme. The Guiness Trust was chosen as their development partner to allow them to afford the 3.8 million project. The project created 75 new flats available in Hulme.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Homes for Change is one of the only housing cooperatives in the country currently developing housing. Housing coops have been hit hard in the last few years by new legislation and the sector as a whole is under threat. Homes for Change is fighting to build the cooperative sector. The scheme with its mix of housing and workspace, innovative design, green consciousness, and Hulme spirit will be an example to people across the country.</p>
