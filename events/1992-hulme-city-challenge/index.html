    <p>April 1992 saw the launch of <strong>Hulme City Challenge</strong> with Â£37.5 million of government money as a catalyst for funding a comprehensive programme to tackle the economic, social and physical problems of the area, through partnership between the public, private and voluntary sectors and the local community. The project provided a second opportunity to create a new neighbourhood but this time with the character of a more traditional urban community.</p>
