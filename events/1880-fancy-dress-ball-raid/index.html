      <p>In late September 1880, a Temperance Hall in Hulme was booked under the auspices of the Pawnbrokers Association. This Hall was subsequently raided when something that was salaciously called "one of the foulest orgies to ever disgrace any town." 47 men were arrested, 22 of whom were in beautiful female dresses.</p>

<p>But what actually happened?  In late December 1879, Acting Chief Constable Malcolm Wood gave his star pupil, Jerome Caminada, an assignment: the Town Hall had in the previous year been involved in a truly Victorian sex scandal: prostitutes in the Town Hall, with local Councillors, no less and this all splashed over the tabloid press. The Acting Chief Constable needed to be seen to do something about vice. So he sent Caminada on an errand to go after a known class of men, those who dressed in women's clothing and were seen together with other men.</p>

<p>It took nine months of police work (and public money) for Caminada to hit pay dirt: the fancy dress ball mentioned earlier. In total, Caminada (and about 12 other police officers) watched the Hall for about 8 hours and observed what went on inside from a building close to the Hall – through a gap in the window, about 2 inches wide – before making his move.</p>

<p>The people who had rented the Hall had arrived earlier and were stared at by the local populace.  This was a time where entertainments were hard to come by, especially in a slum area like Hulme. So this was fascinating, and soon the ball attendees had to wade through a throng of onlookers. As a consequence, they blacked out the windows with curtains and calico paper, so that they would be left in peace to dance to the music of a blind accordion player and avail themselves of the lemonade.</p>

<p>Caminada saw his chance slipping away when the first people started to leave the Ball and decided to raid it. All 47 men were arrested, and as said earlier, 22 of them were in women's clothing. The rest were either in fancy costumes or dance clothes.</p>

<p>The men were taken to the Town Hall Goal and held overnight with no charge. A presiding Magistrate set the time to decide a charge for the following Thursday, five days after the initial arrest. Some people could afford to post bail at that time. Others had to stay in their fancy costumes in Belle Vue Goal until the following Thursday when they were allowed to change.</p>

<p>The court date was to set a charge. At this point, bail had been posted and some people had spent nearly a week in goal – on no charge.</p>

<p>Some of the men had managed to secure legal representation and this ensured that the case was thrown out of court on the bases of a) a complete lack of evidence: the police wanted to have the men charged with buggery, attempted buggery, and conspiring to attempt buggery without any proof; b) the conviction of the Magistrate that such a thing could not happen in Manchester. This is not Turkey, you know. The racism in his closing speech is quite astonishing.</p>

<p>Now, while this has all been going on, the press has had an absolute field day: another sex scandal to entertain the masses. The arrests were widely reported, even Sodom and Gomorrah inferred by a Salford Paper. Everyone was convinced that an orgy had taken place, complete with men dressed as perfect women. The fact that the Magistrate threw the case out attracted minimal attention, as did the fact that some men could not afford the second bail posting and had to spend three months in Belle Vue Goal.</p>

<p>Needless to say, all the involved police officers were given a promotion despite the lack of a case, let alone a conviction.</p>
