      <p>"From Hulme All Blessings Flow, A Collection of Manchester Memories" is the memoirs of Harry Watkin, who was born and grew up in Hulme in the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has taken a long time for these recollections to appear in this form, The idea was born some time in my twenties when l found that l could recall incidents and mental pictures of my childhood, the clarity and detail of which often surprised my friends, who seemed to have retained only a vague impression of their early days. I started to make notes of these memories to ensure that as I got older they would not disappear into oblivion. And why did I bother to do this? Nostalgia, pure and simple.</p>
