**Hulme Hall** was a medieval manor house on the banks of the River Irwell — one of the oldest buildings in the Manchester area, with origins dating back to at least the reign of Henry II (1133–1189).

## Medieval Origins

The hall was owned by **John de Hulme** during the reign of Henry II, and passed to the de Rossindale family by the time of Edward I. During Henry IV's reign, it came into the hands of a branch of the Prestwich baronets, who held it for centuries.

In 1660–61, Sir Thomas Prestwich sold Hulme Hall to **Sir Edward Mosley, 2nd Baronet**. According to Edward Baines, around this time the hall was "among the most stately residences in the parish of Manchester."

## Architecture and Gardens

The hall was built around a quadrangle with its front facing the left bank of the Irwell, surrounded by a large forest. It stood on red sandstone, overlooking the river near its confluence with the Medlock.

In the 18th century, the gardens of Hulme Hall "were celebrated for their beauty, and decorated with various works of art and antiquity, among which were several Roman altars and other remains."

## Demolition

Hulme Hall was **demolished around 1840** to make way for buildings and works connected with the Bridgewater Canal expansion. As one historian noted: "murky smoke begrimed workshops and mills now cover the site."

The area that once held the stately manor and its celebrated gardens was transformed into the industrial heart of Victorian Hulme.

## Legacy

The name "Hulme" itself derives from the Old Norse *holmr* meaning "island" or "water meadow" — reflecting the area's geography at the confluence of the Irwell and Medlock rivers where the hall once stood.
