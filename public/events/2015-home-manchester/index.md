**HOME** is Manchester's major arts centre, combining cinema, theatre, and gallery space in a striking purpose-built building on First Street, on the edge of Hulme.

## Formation

HOME was formed through the merger of two beloved Manchester arts organisations:

## The Building

- Five cinemas
- Two theatres
- 500 m² gallery space
