**HOME** is Manchester's major arts centre, combining cinema, theatre, and gallery space in a striking purpose-built building on First Street, on the edge of Hulme.

## Formation

HOME was formed through the merger of two beloved Manchester arts organisations:

- **Cornerhouse** (1985–2015): A centre for cinema and contemporary visual arts on Oxford Street, which hosted the UK premiere of Quentin Tarantino's *Reservoir Dogs* and was the first UK public gallery to commission work from Damien Hirst
- **Library Theatre Company** (1952–2015): Manchester's repertory theatre company, which had operated in Manchester Central Library

## The Building

Opened **21 May 2015**, HOME occupies a distinctive triangular building designed by Dutch architects **Mecanoo**. The iridescent glazed facade with irregularly spaced fins creates a dynamic appearance.

The £25 million venue includes:
- Five cinemas
- Two theatres
- 500 m² gallery space
