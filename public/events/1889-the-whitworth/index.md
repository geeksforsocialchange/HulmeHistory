**The Whitworth** is an art gallery in Whitworth Park containing over 60,000 items, now part of the University of Manchester.

## Founding

The gallery was founded in **1889** by Robert Dukinfield Darbishire using funds from Sir Joseph Whitworth's will. Whitworth, who died in Monte Carlo in 1887, left £1,227,781—equivalent to over £160 million today.

The gallery was established for "the perpetual gratification of the people of Manchester" and was the first English gallery in a park.
