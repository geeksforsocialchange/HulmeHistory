The **Manchester Gay Centre** on Sidney Street was Europe's first purpose-built, publicly funded gay community centre, opening on **27 November 1988**.

## Planning and Construction

After outgrowing the Bloom Street premises, planners identified a Canal Street site in 1986 with £118,000 approved for purchase. However, the landowner refused to sell to a gay organisation. A new site on Sidney Street was identified in 1987.

The **Planning Committee approved the proposals on 24th August 1987**, despite an infamous petition signed by 147 people opposing the centre.

Construction began during the height of the **Section 28** campaign - the national resistance movement was headquartered at the old Bloom Street centre while the new building rose.

## Opening

The first event held at the new centre was the opening party on **27th November 1988**, led by Council Leader **Graham Stringer**. The centre provided meeting spaces, offices, a cafe, and facilities for LGBT organisations and community groups.

## Later Years

- **2000**: Management transferred to the Lesbian Community Project
- **2010**: Faced closure threats; dedicated to long-time activist **Joyce Layland**
- **2012**: LGBT Youth North West (later The Proud Trust) took over management
- **2019**: Farewell festival held in June before demolition

The original 1988 building was demolished and replaced with a new three-storey facility, reopening as **The Proud Place** in 2022.
