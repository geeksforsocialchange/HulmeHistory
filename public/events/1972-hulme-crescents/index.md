The **Hulme Crescents** were four massive deck-access housing blocks completed in **1972** — the largest public housing development in Europe, with 3,284 homes and capacity for over 13,000 people. They were demolished just 21 years later, a symbol of the failure of modernist mass housing.

## Design and Inspiration

Designed by **Hugh Wilson** and **J.L. Womersley** (who also delivered Sheffield's Park Hill flats and Manchester's Arndale Centre), the Crescents drew inspiration from Georgian terraces in Bath and Bloomsbury.

Each of the four south-facing, U-shaped blocks was seven storeys high and named after a distinguished architect: **Adam, Nash, Barry and Kent**.

The deck-access design was intended to "encourage a neighbourly spirit" and replicate the intimacy of terraced streets. Decks were wide enough for milk floats to pass.

## Rapid Decline

Problems appeared almost immediately:

- **Condensation and dampness** due to inadequate insulation
- Mould in bedrooms and vermin spreading through service ducts
- The **1973 oil crisis** made underfloor heating prohibitively expensive
- In **1974**, a five-year-old child died falling from a balcony
- By **1975**, 96% of residents wanted to leave

Two years after opening, Manchester City Council deemed the Crescents unsuitable for families. In 1978, the chair of the Housing Committee called them "an absolute disaster — it shouldn't have been planned, it shouldn't have been built."

## Cultural Life

Despite their problems, the Crescents developed a vibrant counter-culture in the 1980s, with cheap rents attracting students, artists, and musicians. This creative community is documented in the *Views from the Crescents* book and continues to influence the area today.

## Demolition and Aftermath

Demolition began in **1993**. Hulme was subsequently redeveloped at a cost of £400 million through the **Hulme City Challenge** programme, with residents advocating for traditional terraced housing.
