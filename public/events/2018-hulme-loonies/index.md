**Hulme Loonies** is an ongoing photography project by **Anni Kay**, documenting the anarchist and countercultural community of Hulme through her Instagram account.

## The Photographer

Anni Kay is a young photographer who moved to her father's flat in Hulme after his death. Her parents were punks active in Manchester during the 1990s, giving her a personal connection to the area's subcultural legacy.

## What She Documents

The project, which began in 2018, captures both the historical context of Hulme - referencing the 1970s-80s punk era and the demolished Crescents - and contemporary community life.

Key themes include:

- **Community Spirit**: Multi-generational gatherings where families mix with ravers - "you can be getting pissed with a 60-year-old and a 22-year-old, bonding around a fire pit"
- **Political Identity**: Anarchist, left-leaning values emphasizing DIY culture and squat politics, encapsulated in graffiti declaring *"We're From Hulme and We Don't Pay"*
- **Cultural Expression**: Parties, fire pit gatherings, film screenings, art exhibitions, and electronic/jungle music events

## Style

Kay's photos capture a lifestyle "out of step with a world that's been increasingly homogenized" - documenting raw hedonism and community defiance amid urban gentrification. Her work shows that the spirit of Hulme's countercultural past lives on in its present.
