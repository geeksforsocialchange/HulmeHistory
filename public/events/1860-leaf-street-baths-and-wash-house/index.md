In 1860, the Manchester and Salford Baths and Laundries Company asked Thomas Worthington to build their third bath and wash house in Salford and Manchester. The first one was on Collier Street in Salford in 1855, the second one in Ardwick in 1858.

Leaf Street Baths had a number of slipper baths (for individuals to wash themselves in bath tubs), a males first and second class plunge pool (probably only about 1.5m deep), a females first and second class plunge pool (about the same depth as the males'), and a laundry. A Turkish Baths was later added to complete the Victorian splendor.

The Manchester Corporation bought Leaf Street Baths from the struggling Manchester and Salford Baths and Laundries Company in 1875 and ran it for the next hundred years.

Leaf Street Baths was damaged in the Manchester Blitz but repaired and kept open until the slum clearances in the 1970s where it was demolished in 1976.
