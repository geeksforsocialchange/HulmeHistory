**Leonard Benker Johnson** (22 October 1902 - 1974) was born in Clayton, Manchester to an English mother of Irish descent and a father from Sierra Leone. He became one of Britain's greatest boxers - and a pioneering anti-racism activist who helped break down the colour bar.

## Boxing Career

Johnson competed from 1920 to 1933, retiring with a record of 95-33-7 (36 knockouts). He held the British Empire middleweight title and the Northern Area championships at middleweight and light-heavyweight.

Despite being at the peak of his abilities, **he was denied the chance to compete for the British middleweight title**. The British Boxing Board of Control formally stated he could not compete because of the colour of his skin - the "colour bar" that was in place from 1911 until 1948.

## Fighting Discrimination

The interracial marriage of Len's parents meant the family experienced real racism - his mother Margaret was once attacked in the street because she was the wife of a Black man, suffering permanent disfigurement.

In the post-war years, Johnson spent much of his time challenging unwritten 'colour bars' in Manchester. He was instrumental in influencing the dissolving of the British boxing colour bar in 1947, enabling Dick Turpin to become Britain's first Black boxing champion in 1948.

## The Old Abbey Taphouse Protest

On 30 September 1953, Johnson made a conscious decision when walking into the Old Abbey Taphouse pub in Hulme. He was refused service because of the colour of his skin. The police were called, and Johnson and his companions were thrown out.

The next day, they went to see the Lord Mayor and the Bishop of Manchester, getting statements that they "deprecated this action." They then organised a mass picket of around 200 people - Black and white activists from the Communist Party and progressive groups. **The colour bar was lifted within days.**

Johnson also created the 'New International Club' - an explicitly anti-racist social space in Manchester.

## Legacy

A petition has been launched to have Johnson commemorated with a statue in Manchester, supported by boxers Anthony Joshua and Ricky Hatton, and Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham.
