The **Gaythorn Gas Works** operated on what is now First Street from 1825 to 1929, producing gas for Manchester for over a century.

## Origins

The site opened in 1825 when the Provincial Portable Gas Company of London constructed works for producing gas that was compressed into copper cylinders for distribution. In 1837, James Fernley acquired the operation and transformed it into a conventional gas production facility.

## Scale of Operations

During its operational period, an estimated **6.6 million tons of coal** were carbonized to generate roughly 70.6 billion cubic feet of gas. By 1894, the Corporation owned four gas stations: Gaythorn, Rochdale Road, Bradford Road, and Droylsden.

## Closure

Production ended in **1929** when the plant became obsolete. The site was converted into a distribution hub with storage gasometers before final closure.

## Remediation

Significant environmental remediation was required before redevelopment. Workers excavated approximately 60,000 cubic meters of contaminated soil and removed bitumen and asbestos materials from infilled gas-holders and tar wells.

## First Street Today

The site now houses the **First Street** development, including HOME arts centre (opened 2015) and the **Gasworks Brew Bar** (opened 2016), which preserves the industrial heritage in its name and design.
