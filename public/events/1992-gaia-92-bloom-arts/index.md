Gaia '92 was an art project created in 1992 by Hulme residents. It was later renamed bLoOm arts.

> Gaia '92 has been launched to introduce art into the Hulme City Challenge.
> Hulme today probably. has a greater number of artists per square mile than any other part of Manchester and possibly the country. There are also writers, photogra­phers, musicians, actors and video artists. The role of art in our cities is now widely accepted, it brings life to the streets, it makes a place unique, it adds character, interest and humanity. The role of art in regeneration is also increasingly recognised as a powerful tool to show confidence in an area's future, to improve the environment and the image given to the outside world.
> Gaia '92 will enable local artists to get involved in the Hulme City Challenge process.

_Extract from Gaia 92 Information Leaflet_

> Gaia started with an article in the Hulme PIG (Public Information Gazette) to campaign for art in City Challenge. It ask where is the missing I% of the budget which should be devoted to the arts? This is accepted elsewhere by both public and private organisations why not in Hulme? We all know that the housing, social and economic problems are the priority and with tight budgets and hard pressed public agencies it is difficult to argue for the arts. But Gaia does not argue for art for arts sake. It believes that the redevelopment will be all the more successful if the arts are taken seriously as a regeneration tool.
