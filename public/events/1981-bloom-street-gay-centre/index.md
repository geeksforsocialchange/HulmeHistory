In 1981, the Manchester Gay Centre relocated from its cramped basement on Oxford Road to **61A Bloom Street** in what would become known as Manchester's Gay Village.

## Services

The Bloom Street centre significantly expanded its offerings:

- **Lesbian Link** - telephone helpline
- **Manchester Gay Switchboard** - information and support line
- **Friend** - befriending service
- Youth group
- Meeting spaces for community groups
- **SNAX** - a late-night cafe

## Section 28

The centre became a focal point of resistance during the campaign against **Section 28** of the Local Government Act 1988, which prohibited local authorities from "promoting homosexuality." The national campaign against Section 28 was headquartered at Bloom Street.

## Move to Sidney Street

By 1986, the centre had outgrown its Bloom Street home. After a failed attempt to purchase a Canal Street site (the landowner refused to sell to a gay organisation), a new purpose-built centre was planned for Sidney Street, opening in November 1988.
