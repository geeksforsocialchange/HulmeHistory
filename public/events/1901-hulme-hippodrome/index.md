The Hulme Hippodrome opened on 7 October 1901 as the **Grand Junction Theatre and Floral Hall** on Preston Street. Designed by renowned theatre architect JJ Alley and built by the Broadhead family company, it originally seated up to 3,300 people crammed on long benches.

Its "younger twin" sister theatre, The Playhouse, followed on 6 October 1902. The two theatres swapped names around 1906-07.

## A Century of Entertainment

The Hippodrome served many purposes over the decades:

- **Music hall and variety theatre** in its early years
- **Repertory theatre** in the 1940s
- **BBC recording venue** for programmes with live audiences (1950-1956)
- **Bingo hall** from 1962 until 1986

The theatre was refurbished in 1950 with individual tip-up seats for 1,300 people, and the gallery was reopened.

## Wartime Closure

The Hippodrome closed on Saturday 18 January 1941 during the Manchester Blitz. Correspondence stated: *"We have been compelled to close this theatre because of the serious effect the enemy action on Manchester has had upon business."*

## Current Status

The Hulme Hippodrome is now a shuttered Grade II listed building, a proscenium arch theatre with two galleries and a side hall. It was used by a church from 2003 until closure in 2018.

Following rumours in 2020 of redevelopment to residential units, a campaign group **Save Hulme Hippodrome** formed with the ambition to save, restore and reopen the building as a community, music and arts hub.
