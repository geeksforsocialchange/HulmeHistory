**The Proud Place** is a new three-storey LGBT+ community centre on Sidney Street, opened in 2022 on the site of the original 1988 Manchester Gay Centre.

## Redevelopment

Following The Proud Trust's takeover of the ageing Sidney Street centre in 2012, a major redevelopment project was launched:

- **£2.5 million** secured for redevelopment
- **June 2019**: Farewell festival celebrating the original building
- The 1988 building was demolished
- New three-storey purpose-built facility constructed
- **2022**: Reopened as The Proud Place

## The Proud Trust

The Proud Place is operated by **The Proud Trust**, an LGBT+ youth charity. The centre provides:

- Youth groups and activities
- Support services
- Meeting spaces
- Training and education facilities

## Location

The centre occupies "one of the city's most diverse urban blocks, home to an evangelical church and conference centre, a plethora of fast-food takeaways and a pub, Manchester's Islamic Centre, a vegan wholefoods cooperative as well as the LGBT Centre."

## Legacy

The Proud Place continues over 40 years of LGBT+ community provision on the same site, from the pioneering 1988 centre through to today's modern facility serving a new generation.
