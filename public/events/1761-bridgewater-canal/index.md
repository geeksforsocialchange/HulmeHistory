The **Bridgewater Canal** was the world's first true industrial canal and Britain's first arterial canal. Opened on **17 July 1761**, it connected the coal mines at Worsley to Manchester, terminating at Castlefield Basin.

## Background

The canal was commissioned by **Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater**, to transport coal from his mines at Worsley to Manchester. It was engineered by **James Brindley**, a brilliant self-taught mechanic.

## Engineering Achievement

The canal was revolutionary for its time:

- Built without following an existing watercourse
- No locks in Brindley's original design
- The **Barton Aqueduct** carried the canal over the River Irwell — work commenced September 1760, first boat crossed 17 July 1761
- Terminus at **Castlefield Basin**, where the River Medlock helped supply water

## Economic Impact

The canal's success was immediate and dramatic:

- Within a year of opening, the price of coal in Manchester fell by **about half**
- Construction cost £168,000 (equivalent to £33 million in 2023)
- At its peak, the canal transported over 3 million tonnes of cargo annually
- Its success inspired **Canal Mania** — a period of intense canal building across Britain

## Connection to Hulme

The canal's expansion led to significant changes in Hulme. Around 1840, **Hulme Hall** — a medieval manor house that had stood for nearly 700 years — was demolished to make way for canal-related buildings and works.

## Legacy

The Bridgewater Canal is described as "the first great achievement of the canal age." It helped fuel the Industrial Revolution by enabling cheap movement of coal into Manchester, transforming the city into the world's first industrial metropolis.
