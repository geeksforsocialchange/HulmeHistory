**The Haçienda** (FAC 51) was a nightclub and music venue in Manchester that became world-famous during the Madchester years of the 1980s and early 1990s. Run by Factory Records and the band New Order, it opened in 1982 and helped pioneer the Manchester acid house and rave scene.

## Origins

Before the Haçienda, Factory Records had hosted live music in Hulme for a short while. The club itself was located on Whitworth Street West, designed by Ben Kelly with its iconic yellow and black hazard stripes.

## The Madchester Explosion

During the so-called "Madchester" music explosion in the latter half of the 1980s, the Haçienda played a pioneering role in the birth of electronic dance music. Manchester became the most talked-about music city in the world, with the club hosting legendary DJ sets and live performances.

## Troubles

Despite its cultural significance, the club was plagued by financial troubles throughout its existence - it reportedly lost money for most of its operation. Security became a serious problem in later years, with several shootings inside and outside the club leading to troubled relations with police and licensing authorities.

The UK's first Ecstasy-related death occurred at the Haçienda in 1989, as the rave scene became associated with drug culture.

## Closure

The Haçienda lost its entertainments licence in June 1997. The last club night was on **28 June 1997**, a night called "Freak" featuring DJs Miles Hollway, Elliot Eastwick and Dave Haslam. The final live performance was by Spiritualized on 15 June 1997.

After closure, the building was used for two free parties organised by the Manchester free party scene - one ended in a police siege while the party continued inside. The building was eventually demolished and replaced with apartments.

## Legacy

The Haçienda's influence on British music and club culture remains immense. Its story has been told in numerous books, films and documentaries, and "Haçienda" nights continue to be held around the world.
