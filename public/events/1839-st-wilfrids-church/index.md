St Wilfrid's Church on George Street was a Roman Catholic church designed by the renowned Gothic Revival architect **Augustus Welby Pugin** - his only known church building in Manchester. Construction began in 1839 and was completed in 1842, though a planned tower was never built.

## "St Wilfrid's in the Fields"

For some years after opening in 1842, the church was known as "St Wilfrid's in the Fields" - there were many complaints that it was built too far into the country! The congregation came mostly from the Chester Road and Deansgate areas.

## Serving the Irish Community

The church served Manchester's growing Irish immigrant population. In 1843 there were 237 infant baptisms; within five years this had increased to more than 500. By 1850, the parish likely served more than 12,000 people. The church had Irish priests from County Kerry continuously from the 1890s until the 1930s.

## The 1852 Riot Scare

In July 1852, during a period of anti-Catholic demonstrations following sectarian riots in nearby Stockport, a rumour spread that Protestant mobs intended to burn down the church. A fight in a local pub was misconstrued as an imminent attack, and a large mob of Irish people arrived to defend the building - against a non-existent threat.

## Architectural Significance

Although the design may now appear ordinary, it was highly original for its time. Until St Wilfrid's, almost every 19th century church in Manchester had been built of stone and was strictly symmetrical. Pugin deliberately placed the tower at the end of an aisle rather than centrally on the west front. The building was designated Grade II listed in December 1963.

## Closure and Conversion

Facing declining enrollment, the parish was suppressed and the church was deconsecrated in 1990. It was converted into a factory manufacturing beds, and in 1994 became an enterprise centre with workshop and business start-up units.
