**Black Panther: Emory Douglas and the Art of Revolution** was a groundbreaking exhibition at Urbis in Manchester, running from **30 October 2008 to 19 April 2009**. Museums Journal called it the "exhibition of the decade."

## About Emory Douglas

**Emory Douglas** (born 1943) was the Minister of Culture for the Black Panther Party from 1967 until the Party disbanded in the 1980s. As a revolutionary artist, Douglas created iconography to represent Black American oppression—his posters, pamphlets and newspapers created a heroic, Soviet-style visual identity for the Black Panthers.

Little known outside the US, Douglas was once considered by the FBI as part of "the greatest threat to the internal security" of America.

## The Exhibition

Looking back 40 years to the iconic moment at the 1968 Mexico Olympics when John Carlos and Tommy Smith raised their fists in a Black Power salute, the exhibition explored the meaning and history behind the gesture through Douglas's graphic artwork.

Previously unseen in the UK, the exhibition displayed hundreds of Douglas's works including:
- Posters and cartoons
- Campaign pamphlets
- Newspapers from The Black Panther publication

## Community Impact

During his visit, Emory Douglas met with young people from Moss Side and shared how his powerful artworks communicated messages of resistance and social justice. The young people worked with him to create their own versions of revolutionary artwork.

Two participants from this 2009 workshop later became trustees of **Rekindle**, the youth-led education initiative in Hulme—demonstrating the lasting impact of the exhibition on local communities.

## About Urbis

Urbis was an exhibition centre of urban and popular culture in Cathedral Gardens, Manchester, operating from 2002 to 2010. It closed on 27 February 2010 to become the National Football Museum.
