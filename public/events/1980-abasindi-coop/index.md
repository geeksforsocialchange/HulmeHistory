The **Abasindi Co-operative** was a Black women's educational, cultural, and political organisation based in Moss Side.

## Origins

In 1975, **Kath Locke** and her sisters helped establish the Manchester Black Women's Co-operative (MBWC), which provided training for Black mothers seeking to re-enter the workforce. On 26 October 1979, when organisers tried to relocate the women's group, the founding members staged a ten-day occupation. On 1 January 1980, the MBWC reformed as the **Abasindi Co-operative**, completely autonomous from external institutions.

Founders included Kath Locke, **Elouise Edwards**, Duduzile Lethlaku, Yvonne Hypolite, Maria Noble, Popgee Manderson, Madge Gordon, Abena Braithwaite, and Shirley Inniss. The women came from Barbados, Trinidad, Aruba, South Africa, Jamaica, and Britain.

## Activities

Abasindi ran a wide range of programmes:

- **Saturday classes** in science, maths, English, and Black history
- Strong focus on women's education and issues
- Political campaigning (including on immigration laws)
- Educational, cultural, and political activities throughout the 1980s

## Self-Reliance

A defining characteristic of Abasindi was that it **never sought or accepted public funding**, emphasising self-reliance and independence from state institutions.

## Decline

The co-operative lost momentum in the 1990s, partly due to early deaths among founders. It was never formally dissolved.

## Legacy

**Adele Jones**, a member who later became Professor at Huddersfield, co-authored the book *Catching Hell and Doing Well: Black Women in the UK - Abasindi Co-operative* (2015), documenting the organisation's history and impact.
