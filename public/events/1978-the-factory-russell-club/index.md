**The Russell Club** (also known as **The Factory** or **PSV Club**) was a working men's club on **Royce Road, Hulme** that became one of the most important venues in Manchester music history. It was here that **Factory Records** launched and **Joy Division** played some of their earliest gigs.

## Origins

The venue was originally the **PSV Club** (Public Service Vehicle — a club for bus workers) at **11 Royce Road**. In 1978, Tony Wilson and Alan Erasmus began hosting gigs there under the name **The Factory**.

The name "Royce Road" itself commemorates **Henry Royce**, whose engineering workshop was located nearby in the 1880s.

## Factory Nights

The first Factory night was held on **9 June 1978**. The club nights featured:

- Joy Division (then still called Warsaw)
- Cabaret Voltaire
- The Durutti Column
- A Certain Ratio
- Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark

These nights directly led to the formation of **Factory Records** in late 1978, with the club's aesthetic — designed by **Peter Saville** — establishing the label's iconic visual identity.

## Joy Division

Joy Division played numerous times at The Factory/Russell Club between 1978 and 1980. The venue's intimate, raw atmosphere suited their intense performances. Ian Curtis's stage presence became legendary in this space.

## Significance

The Russell Club was crucial to Manchester's post-punk scene:

- Factory Records grew from club night to internationally significant label
- The "Madchester" movement can trace its roots here
- Peter Saville's design work for Factory nights established his career
- The venue connected punk energy with art school aesthetics

## Closure and Legacy

The club closed in the early 1980s. The building no longer exists, but the area's musical heritage lives on. The spirit of The Factory/Russell Club continued at The Haçienda, which Factory Records opened in 1982.
