The **Nia Cultural Centre** was established as a steering committee in 1983, with the goal of creating a major arts venue celebrating African and Caribbean cultures. In 1989, the group purchased a historic theatre building from the BBC - the former Playhouse Theatre on Warwick Street.

## Opening Night

The Nia Centre's official opening was in the week of **2 May 1991**, featuring a performance by the legendary **Nina Simone**. The venue claimed to be "the first large-scale, Black-led arts centre in Europe" and held a 900-seat theatre licence including the circle.

## The Building

The building had a rich history before becoming the Nia Centre:

- Originally built as the Hulme Playhouse in 1902, designed by theatre architect JJ Alley
- Used as BBC studios from 1955-1986 (known as BBC Playhouse)
- The Beatles made their radio debut here on 7 March 1962

## Challenges

The Nia Centre struggled with funding, building maintenance issues and management challenges. It has been described as "the little-documented failure" of the UK's first Black arts centre. The venue closed in 2000.

## NIAMOS (2018-present)

The theatre stood mostly unused through the 2000s, briefly used as a church, until it was sold at auction in 2017. In 2018, it reopened as **NIAMOS** (Niamos Radical Arts Centre), run by a grassroots group of local artists and creatives.

Today NIAMOS is a community hub providing spaces to create, learn, dance and share - a co-operatively run visual arts centre, music studio, micro-bakery and arts venue, reclaiming this historic building for the community.
