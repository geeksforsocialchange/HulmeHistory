The **Abasindi Co-operative** was a Black women's educational, cultural, and political organisation founded in Moss Side in the late 1970s.

## Origins

The co-operative was formed in response to social, political, educational, and economic challenges facing Black women in Manchester. Notable founders included **Diana Watt**, who later became an academic.

## Activities

Abasindi ran a wide range of programmes:

- **Saturday classes** in science, maths, English, and Black history
- Strong focus on women's education and issues
- Political campaigning (including on immigration laws)
- Educational, cultural, and political activities throughout the 1980s

## Self-Reliance

A defining characteristic of Abasindi was that it **never sought or accepted public funding**, emphasising self-reliance and independence from state institutions.

## Decline

The co-operative lost momentum in the 1990s, partly due to early deaths among founders. It was never formally dissolved.

## Legacy

**Adele Jones**, a member who later became Professor at Huddersfield, co-authored the book *Catching Hell and Doing Well: Black Women in the UK - Abasindi Co-operative* (2015), documenting the organisation's history and impact.
