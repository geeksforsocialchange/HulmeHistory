**Dogs of Heaven** was a site-specific performance company created by Michael Mayhew that operated in Hulme during the early 1990s, using the Brutalist landscape of the Crescents as an arena for spectacular performances combining fire, dance, kinetic sculpture, and pyrotechnics.

## The Work

Rather than traditional fireworks displays, Dogs of Heaven drew inspiration from Spanish pyrotechnic performance companies to create visual performances featuring "bodies in close contact with fire and explosive devices, of structures, effigies, and noise."

The company combined:
- Kinetic sculpture
- Dancers and circus performers
- Light projection
- Fireworks and pyrotechnics
- Live musicians

## Community Involvement

Dogs of Heaven operated as "one of Britain's biggest community site-specific companies," collaborating with diverse volunteers including car mechanics, welders, musicians, costume makers, circus performers, and academics—people not typically perceived as artists.

## Safe As Houses (1993)

Their most notable performance was **Safe As Houses** in 1993, staged during the demolition of the Hulme Crescents. The event featured:
- A funeral procession through the streets
- Circus performers and fire breathers
- A 7-storey skeleton with lights and projections
- Abandoned vehicles dropped from the Crescent's roof
- Music and ritual marking the end of an era

The performance served as both celebration and protest as residents were displaced through compulsory purchase orders and the Crescents awaited demolition.
