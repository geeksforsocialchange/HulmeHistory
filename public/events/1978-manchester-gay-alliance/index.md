The **Manchester Gay Alliance** operated the first Gay Centre in Manchester from a 700 square foot basement at **178 Waterloo Place on Oxford Road**.

## History

By 1978, the centre had secured council funding and provided essential services to the LGBT community including:

- Information telephone lines
- Counselling services
- Befriending services

The basement space served the community until 1981 when growing demand necessitated a move to larger premises on Bloom Street.

## Significance

This was one of the earliest publicly-funded LGBT community spaces in Britain, predating the purpose-built Sidney Street centre by a decade.
