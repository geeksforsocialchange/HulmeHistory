The **Church of St George** on Chester Road is an early Gothic Revival church designed by **Francis Goodwin**, built 1826–1828. It was one of the "Commissioners' Churches" built to celebrate victory at the Battle of Waterloo.

## Construction

The foundation stone was laid by the Bishop of Chester on land donated by Wilbraham Egerton MP of Tatton Park, Cheshire. The total cost was £20,000, of which Parliament (through the Church Commissioners) paid nearly £15,000.

The church was consecrated on **9 December 1828** by the Bishop of Chester, Dr John Bird Sumner, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury. The first incumbent was Revd. Joshua Lingard M.A.

## Architecture

The church features a tall tower with spires reaching **135 feet** — the highest in Manchester at the time of construction. It has a fine galleried interior typical of the Gothic Revival style.

The building was designated **Grade II* listed** on 3 October 1974 and was restored in 1884 by J.S. Crowther.

## Role in the Community

St George's served as both the **parish church of Hulme** and the garrison church for the nearby Hulme Barracks. The graveyard contains many interesting gravestones from the 19th century.

In 1955 it joined with St Mary's, which became the parish church of Hulme.

## Closure and Conversion

The church closed in **1984** after over 150 years of service. After standing derelict for many years, it was converted to residential flats in 2000–2002.
