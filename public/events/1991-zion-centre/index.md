The **Zion Community Health and Resource Centre** was opened by local community activists in 1991, emerging from Hulme's vibrant grassroots community during a time of severe housing and social challenges.

## Origins

In the late 1980s, Hulme faced significant difficulties but possessed "a really strong, vibrant and active community determined to do things for themselves." Manchester City Council provided a free year's lease and £17,000 grant to establish the centre.

## Growth

The centre expanded significantly over the following years:

- **1991**: Zion Community Health and Resource Centre opened
- **1996**: Took on the Kath Locke Centre, becoming the first non-statutory organisation to run a primary care centre in the country
- **1997**: Incorporated as a charity to secure major NHS contracts
- **2002**: The Big Life Group was officially created when the organisation acquired Big Issue North for £1

## Legacy

What started as a single community health centre evolved into a sprawling network delivering mental health services, childcare, education, employment support, and housing assistance across Northern England.

The Big Life Group remains active today, a testament to the power of community-led action that emerged from Hulme in the early 1990s.
