The **Mancunian Way** is a two-mile elevated motorway running south of Manchester city centre. Opened in 1967, it was the first elevated main road built outside London and fundamentally changed the relationship between Hulme and the city centre.

## Planning and Purpose

The road was conceived as part of the South East Lancashire and North East Cheshire (SELNEC) Highway Plan of 1962. A Parliamentary Bill was approved in 1961. During design it was known as "Link Road 17/7."

Its primary purpose was to carry commercial traffic between the industrial east side of the conurbation and Manchester Docks and Trafford Park, relieving congestion in the city centre. It also served as a distributor between heavily trafficked radial roads south of the centre.

## Construction

Construction occurred in two phases between 1963 and 1967:

- **Phase 1** (November 1963): A 950-yard dual carriageway east of the A6
- **Phase 2** (December 1964): The elevated motorway section between A6 and A56

The elevated section is a prestressed concrete structure **3,232 feet long** with 28 spans of 105 feet and two spans of 60 feet. The spans are made of precast concrete hollow box-units, post-tensioned to form a spine beam.

## Opening

The Mancunian Way was officially opened by **Prime Minister Harold Wilson** on **5 May 1967**. The scheme cost £5.5 million (equivalent to £126 million today).

The Manchester Evening News called it the "highway in the sky." The day before the official opening, pedestrians were allowed to walk the entire high-level route as a publicity exercise — many brought picnics which they ate in the centre of the carriageway.

## Impact on Hulme

The construction marked a significant shift in Manchester's urban fabric, effectively **dividing the city centre from its southern neighbourhoods**. The elevated motorway, spanning streets including Medlock Street, Cambridge Street, Oxford Road, and Brook Street, required the demolition of homes and workplaces.

It severed longstanding pedestrian and community connections between the central area and inner-city estates like Hulme and Moss Side — contributing to the social isolation that would characterise the area in subsequent decades.

## Later History

- **1970s**: Upgraded to motorway status as the A57(M), speed limit raised to 50 mph
- **August 2015**: Part of the non-motorway section collapsed due to a sinkhole
- **June 2016**: Fully reopened after 10 months of repair work
