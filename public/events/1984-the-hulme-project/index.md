> The Hulme Project has now been in existence for three years. During 􀀂hat time officers from the various departments involved in the Hulme Project have been working with tenants across the area on a variety of proposals. These range from the demolition end redevelopment of some estates to relatively minor but essential building and landscaping works. Proposals are being developed in response to local needs and the views of local people. An overall strategy for Hulme, of the kind which existed when it was last redeveloped, has been avoided.
