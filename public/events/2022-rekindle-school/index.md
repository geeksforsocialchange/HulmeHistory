**Rekindle** is a youth-led education initiative founded by **Ruth Ibegbuna**, an award-winning charity CEO and former educator, that aims to rekindle love of learning in educationally disengaged young people.

## Origins

Rekindle began with a simple question: "How could schools be better?" Starting with just 8 young people and two teachers meeting in a room before the pandemic, the founding group of Youth Pioneers (aged 16-24) developed what would become a grassroots movement for educational change.

Their original intention was modest—a small supplementary school for local youth. But witnessing educational inequalities during COVID lockdowns, and feedback from burnt-out teachers, they recognised the potential for something broader.

## Timeline

- **April 2022**: Rekindle opened at Manchester Museum's top floor while their gallery underwent renovation
- **November 2022**: Relocated to their current home in **St Mary's Courtyard, Hulme**

## A Building with History

Rekindle's Hulme home carries deep significance—it was previously home to the **Abasindi Co-operative**, founded in 1980 by Kath Locke and Elouise Edwards. Abasindi was a self-help organisation for Black women that included a Saturday school and served as a cultural hub for the community.

The connection to this activist legacy is fitting for an organisation focused on youth-led educational change.

## Connection to Emory Douglas

Two of Rekindle's current trustees participated in a 2009 workshop with **Emory Douglas**, the revolutionary artist and Minister of Culture for the Black Panther Party, during his exhibition at Urbis. They worked with him to create their own versions of revolutionary artwork.
