In **1884**, **Frederick Henry Royce** (1863-1933) established **F.H. Royce and Company** in a workshop in Hulme, Manchester. This modest beginning would eventually lead to the creation of Rolls-Royce, one of the world's most famous engineering companies.

## Origins

Royce moved to Liverpool in 1882 working on street and theatre lighting. In 1884, with just **£20 of savings**, he entered a partnership with Ernest Claremont (who contributed £50). Together they started a business making domestic electric fittings from a workshop in **Cooke Street, Hulme**.

## Business Growth

Business was slow at first, but the company became known for its quality electrical dynamos and cranes:

- By 1895, they were producing electric cranes
- Sales rose from £6,000 in 1897 to £20,000 in 1899
- In 1899, the company became **Royce Ltd** with £30,000 capital
- A new factory was built at Trafford Park

## The Birth of Rolls-Royce

Royce built his first car at the Cooke Street workshop in **1904**. On **4 May 1904**, the Hon. Charles Rolls was introduced to Henry Royce by Henry Edmunds at the Midland Hotel in Manchester.

This meeting led to Rolls-Royce Ltd being formed in **1906**, beginning a legendary partnership that would produce some of the world's finest cars and aeroplane engines.

## Legacy

A blue plaque commemorates the site where "Henry Royce (1863-1933) established his world-renowned tradition of engineering excellence at Cooke Street in the 1880s."

The street where the Russell Club later stood — **Royce Road** — was named after Sir Henry Royce because his factory was located there.
