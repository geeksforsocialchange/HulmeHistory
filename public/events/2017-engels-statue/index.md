The **Statue of Friedrich Engels** is a 12 ft (3.7 m) concrete statue of the German philosopher, unveiled at Tony Wilson Place in Manchester in 2017.

## The Statue's Journey

The Soviet-era statue was originally constructed in the 1970s and installed in the village of **Mala Pereschepyna** in the Poltava Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR.

In 2015, Ukraine passed laws outlawing the public display of Soviet symbols. The statue was removed and discarded in a field, cut in half at the waist.

Artist **Phil Collins** spent two years searching for a statue of Engels to bring to Manchester—the city where Engels had lived while writing *The Condition of the Working Class in England* (1842–1844). After eight months of negotiations, he secured permission to transport the statue.

## The Homecoming

The statue was temporarily displayed at several locations across Europe on its journey to England. It was unveiled on the last day of the **2017 Manchester International Festival** in a performance called **"Ceremony: The Return of Friedrich Engels"**.

Experimental rock musician **Gruff Rhys** performed a bespoke song, *"Communism's Coming Home"*, as the monument emerged from a cloud of stage smoke.

## Engels and Manchester

Friedrich Engels had strong links with Manchester. In 1842, he was sent to work in a mill owned by his family. Guided by his partner **Mary Burns**, he experienced industrial working conditions firsthand.

Manchester inspired his first book and shaped his development as a socialist thinker. He spent the best part of 30 years in the region.
