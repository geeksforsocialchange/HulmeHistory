The **slum clearances** of the 1960s saw the demolition of Hulme's Victorian terraced housing — the same streets that had been built to house workers during the Industrial Revolution. This mass clearance programme displaced thousands of residents and paved the way for the Hulme Crescents.

## Background

By the 1950s, much of Hulme's housing stock was over 100 years old. The terraced houses, originally built for cotton mill workers, lacked modern amenities:

- No indoor bathrooms (outdoor privies shared between houses)
- No hot running water
- Damp and structural problems
- Overcrowding — multiple families in single houses

Manchester City Council designated large areas as "clearance zones" under the Housing Acts, compulsorily purchasing properties for demolition.

## The Human Cost

The clearances broke up established communities that had existed for generations:

- Extended families were separated as residents were rehoused across the city
- Corner shops, pubs, and community spaces disappeared
- The informal support networks of close-knit streets were lost
- Many elderly residents never adjusted to high-rise living

Some residents were temporarily rehoused in the new Crescents while their neighbours' homes were demolished, watching their old streets disappear.

## Scale of Demolition

Between 1960 and 1972, the entire housing stock of much of Hulme was razed:

- Thousands of two-up-two-down terraces demolished
- Streets that had existed since the 1840s erased from the map
- Churches, schools, and community buildings also cleared
- Only a handful of Victorian buildings survived (notably the Hippodrome and some pubs)

## Legacy

The clearances were part of a nationwide slum clearance programme that fundamentally reshaped British cities. In Hulme, the replacement housing — the Crescents — would itself be demolished just 21 years later, making the destruction of the Victorian terraces seem even more tragic in hindsight.

The 1990s Hulme City Challenge regeneration deliberately returned to traditional street patterns and terraced housing, acknowledging what had been lost.
