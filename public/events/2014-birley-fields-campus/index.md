**Birley Fields** is Manchester Metropolitan University's £120 million campus, opened in **September 2014** on the site of the former Hulme Crescents. Named after the historic Birley Fields area, it brought thousands of students into Hulme and marked the final transformation of the Crescents site.

## Development

The campus was designed by **Sheppard Robson** architects and constructed by **Willmott Dixon**:

- **Cost**: £120 million
- **Site**: 6.5 hectares on the former Crescents land
- **Opened**: September 2014
- **Students**: Approximately 5,000 (Education, Health, and Psychology faculties)

The development included:
- Brooks Building — main teaching and learning facility
- Student Union building
- Sports facilities
- Landscaped public spaces

## Replacing the Crescents

The site has a complex history:

1. **Pre-1960s**: Victorian terraced housing
2. **1972-1993**: Hulme Crescents (4 blocks, 3,284 homes)
3. **1993-1995**: Demolition of Crescents
4. **1995-2010s**: Hulme City Challenge housing and open land
5. **2014**: Birley Fields Campus opens

The campus occupies land where the **William Kent Crescent** once stood — one of the four massive deck-access blocks.

## Community Impact

The campus brought significant changes to Hulme:

- Thousands of students living and studying in the area
- New pedestrian and cycle routes connecting to the city centre
- Economic activity in local shops and cafes
- Concerns about studentification displacing long-term residents

## Name Origin

Birley Fields takes its name from the historic open fields in the area. The Birley family were prominent Manchester landowners — Hugh Birley was a mill owner involved in the Peterloo Massacre of 1819.
