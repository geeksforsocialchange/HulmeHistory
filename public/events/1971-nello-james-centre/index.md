The **Nello James Centre** was a community education centre in Moss Side, named after **C.L.R. James** (1901-1989), the Trinidad-born historian, political activist, and leading figure in the pan-African movement. James, author of *The Black Jacobins*, visited the North West in the 1940s and 50s.

## Origins

The building at 136 Withington Road, originally called Walton Cottage, served as a private home from 1887. The British Red Cross used it as an auxiliary hospital between 1914 and 1916 and owned it until 1971.

In 1971, actress **Vanessa Redgrave** provided funds for the Walton Cottage Education Trust to purchase the site from the British Red Cross. She gifted it to the community as a social hub and education facility, naming it in honour of C.L.R. James.

## Activities

The Nello James Centre offered a wide range of services:

- Adult education and a "Free University"
- Day nursery and playground
- Legal advice
- Printing workshop (Moss Side Press)
- Social centre
- African dance classes

The centre published a monthly newspaper for the Moss Side, Hulme, and Whalley Range areas.

## Walton Trust

From **1978**, the centre housed the **Walton Trust**, which organised activities supporting the local African Caribbean community including housing support. By 1990, Walton Trust had secured 65 homes in the area. In 1994, it merged with Arawak Housing Association.

## Closure and Legacy

The centre closed around 2008 and fell into disrepair. The Walton Cottage Education Trust sold the property in January 2020 for £850,000, with plans (later controversial) to create a new centre in Old Trafford.

The **Rekindling Nello James** project now works to preserve the voices, culture, and radical spirit of African and Caribbean communities in South Manchester through storytelling, exhibitions, and digital archives.
