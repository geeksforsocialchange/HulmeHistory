**The Old Abbey Taphouse** is a historic pub on Guildhall Close in Hulme, dating back to at least 1831. It stands on land that was once part of the medieval Hulme Hall estate.

## History

The pub takes its name from Hulme Hall, sometimes called "The Old Abbey" due to its connections with Birkenhead Priory. The original Hulme Hall dated back to the medieval period and was demolished in the 19th century as Hulme industrialised.

## The 1953 Colour Bar Protest

The pub became nationally significant on **30 September 1953** when boxer **Len Johnson** deliberately walked in and was refused service because of the colour of his skin. The police were called and Johnson was thrown out.

The next day, Johnson and his companions met with the Lord Mayor and the Bishop of Manchester. They then organised a mass picket of around 200 Black and white activists. **The colour bar was lifted within days.**

This was one of the first successful direct action protests against racial discrimination in Britain, predating the American civil rights movement's sit-ins by several years.

## Today

The Old Abbey Taphouse remains a community pub and has embraced its civil rights history. A plaque commemorates the 1953 protest and Len Johnson's role in challenging discrimination.
