**Hulme Community Garden Centre** was founded in 1998 by four local residents following Manchester City Council's decision to demolish the Hulme Crescents. After decades of decline, Hulme was being regenerated in the 1990s - but the regeneration failed to create green spaces open to all.

## The Founders

**Richard Lockwood, Geraldine Wall, Andrew Stewart and Neil Francis** came together with an idea: creating a community garden centre on the cleared land. Their core aim was to be *"A garden centre with a difference that makes a difference."*

At the time, Hulme and neighbouring Moss Side were high on the deprivation index. The founders saw that growing could be a great means of bringing the community together and tackling mental health issues.

## Opening

In **April 2000**, Hulme Community Garden Centre opened on Old Birley Street, just two miles from Manchester city centre. It was established on a brownfield site with the goal of encouraging healthy living through gardening and sustainable food growing.

## Growth

Since opening, HCGC has transformed an area of scrubland - and later a car park - into a flourishing public green space covering two acres. The centre welcomes over 10,000 visitors annually and has become a sanctuary for people and wildlife alike.

It was notably the only garden centre in the north west that remained open during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## 25th Anniversary

In 2025, Hulme Community Garden Centre celebrates its 25th anniversary - a quarter-century of growth, learning, and community connection in the heart of Manchester.
