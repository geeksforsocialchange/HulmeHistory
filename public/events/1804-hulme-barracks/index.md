Hulme Barracks was a military installation completed in 1804, built in the Georgian style near Manchester city centre. The barracks served as a base for cavalry soldiers for over a century.

## The Peterloo Connection

The barracks became infamous as the home of the 15th The King's Hussars, the cavalry unit that charged into protesters at St Peter's Field on 16 August 1819 in what became known as the **Peterloo Massacre**. The cavalry charged into a crowd of around 60,000 people who had gathered to demand parliamentary reform, resulting in 15 deaths and hundreds of injuries.

## Military Service

The Royal Dragoons stationed at the barracks were also said to have been involved in the 'Charge of the Light Brigade' during the Crimean War in 1854.

From 1895, the barracks transitioned from cavalry to infantry use, as there were no facilities in Manchester for training cavalry regiments. The barracks housed infantry battalions until their sale to Manchester Corporation in 1914.

## Today

The building that remains today is the former officers' mess, officers' quarters and quartermaster's house - the other structures on the site having been demolished. Now converted into flats, Hulme Barracks was designated a Grade II listed building on 16 November 1978.
