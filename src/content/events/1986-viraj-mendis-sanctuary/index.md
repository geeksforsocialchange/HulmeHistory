**Viraj Mendis** (died 16 August 2024) was a Sri Lankan national who claimed the ancient right of sanctuary at the Church of the Ascension in Hulme - a case that made national and international headlines and sparked a major campaign for refugee rights.

## Background

Mendis had arrived in the UK in October 1973 on a student visa but overstayed. As a Sinhalese supporter of the Tamil cause, he feared for his safety if returned to Sri Lanka. He was politically active, advocating for Tamil rights and running 15 successful anti-deportation campaigns for others facing removal.

## Sanctuary

On **20 December 1986**, as a last resort, Viraj approached Father John Methuen and requested sanctuary at the Church of the Ascension in Hulme. Methuen and members of the parochial council agreed to his request.

For **two years** Mendis lived within the church, unable to leave. A major defence campaign formed around him, drawing support from across the country.

## The Raid

On **18 January 1989**, Greater Manchester Police and immigration officials raided the church and forcibly removed Mendis, who had chained himself to a radiator. More than 2,000 people participated in a march on Moss Side Police Station in protest. The raid led to questions in the House of Commons.

## Aftermath

Mendis was deported back to Sri Lanka. His fears did not materialise - he later said his case had received so much publicity that the Sri Lankan government did not dare to harm him. He was later granted asylum in Germany, where he became chairperson of the International Human Rights Association in Bremen, continuing to work defending refugees.

## Legacy

The case brought international attention to UK asylum policy and the concept of church sanctuary. A BBC Sounds podcast series titled "Sanctuary: An Act of Defiance" tells the full story.

Mendis died on 16 August 2024. His archive has been deposited at the Church of the Ascension.
