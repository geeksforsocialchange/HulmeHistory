HOMOCULT produce often confrontational art at the boundary of class and queer politics.

> "HOMOCULT was formed in 1990 by a small group of people with varying skills ranging from those holding Degrees in Art, to people who had never expressed themselves through Art before.
> What we had in common was that we all shared the experience of having come from low class backgrounds and a powerful desire to explore own own experiences of how we felt our personalities had been moulded by those backgrounds, especially as regards to our sexuality, this being perhaps the most fundamental aspect of our identities, yet at the same time one of the least talked about."
