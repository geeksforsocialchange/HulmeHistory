The **Playhouse Theatre**, originally known as the Hulme Hippodrome, was built in Hulme, Manchester, between 1901 and 1902 and opened on 6 October 1902.

There were two buildings called the Hulme Hippodrome: the **Playhouse Theatre** was the first with the name, given in 1901 when both were built, and the **Grand Junction Theatre and Floral Hall** was the second and took on the name in 1905. The Grand Junction Theatre and Floral Hall is what we now call the Hulme Hippodrome and stands derelict on Warwick Street.

Originally, these two were built as part of W. H. Broadhead's theatre empire and the Playhouse had the company's headquarters in them. Both buildings were connected with an arcade.

The Grand Junction Theatre took on the name Hulme Hippodrome in 1905 and has seen many changes over the last 100 years or so, including a bingo hall and casino as well as several churches.

The Playhouse Theatre was converted into a cinema around 1929 and the BBC bought the re-converted theatre in 1956 and used it to record television and radio plays until 1986. After that, the building was bought by the Council and converted into the Nia Centre which has since closed.
