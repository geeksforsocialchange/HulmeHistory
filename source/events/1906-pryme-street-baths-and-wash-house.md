In 1906, Pryme Street Baths and Wash House was built directly next to Proctor's Gym. Unlike Leaf Street Baths, Pryme Street did not have pools. This building was solely equipped with rows of slipper baths, in a male and female section, and a large laundry.

Pryme Street Baths was destroyed in the slum clearances of the 1960s and 70s.
