The Hulme Guide to Development was commissioned from the Hulme Community Architecture Project which was run at the time by Charlie Baker who enrolled David Rudlin to help. It was published in 1994 by Hulme Regeneration Ltd in order to highlight the opportunities and the weaknesses in Hulme and was part of guiding the urban designs part of the Hulme City Challenge project. Within 6 months of its publication the council had passed a temporary resolution applying it to the whole of Manchester until such time that a city-wide guide could be written.
