> There are major defects in Manchester's Council housing and present financial resources are inadequate to cope with the problems. The defects run right through the stock- deck access, tower blocks, post-war maisonettes and "traditional" housing too. In some cases living conditions are attrocious and there are major health risks as bad or worse than in the old slums. The total bill is £600M.
> The Government's response to the growing problem is to reduce the money available. Manchester's housing investment allocation this year would be £96M if the Government had kept it at the same level as when they came to office. Instead it is only £36M.
> More resources are needed - not less. It makes sense to invest in housing. It makes sense to put the construction industry back to work. It makes sense to give people back one of their most basic human rights - a home fit to live in.
