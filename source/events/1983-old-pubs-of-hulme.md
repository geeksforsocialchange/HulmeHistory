Different people from Hulme tell us about the old pubs in a publication by Bob Potts in 1983.

> Having lived in the district all my life since 1900, l have a good knowledge of Hulme pubs. Some early memories rel足ate to street life in Hulme, such as the frequently seen and heard barrel organs, which had the children dancing in the streets. There was also a dancing bear outside the pubs on Chester Road, which per足formed for our pennies. The bear was owned by an old Italian man. On Egerton Street, off Chester Road, the Egerton Inn kept a champion talking parrot in a cage on the bar足counter. People went in there for a gill and a gab to the parrot. Not surprisingly this pub was nick-named the Birdcage.
