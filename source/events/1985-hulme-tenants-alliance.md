The Hulme Tenants Alliance formed on 25th September 1985.

> The Hulme Tenants Alliance was formed on Tuesday 25th September 1984 at a joint meeting of existing Hulme Tenants groups. Such joint meetings had taken place for some time and it was felt that to establish an ·"umbrella" group to share information and support action on Hulme-wide problems would be of benefit to us all. The joint tenants meet,ings were being serviced at the time by the newly appointed Tenants Liaison Officer for the area, who was present at this meeting and actively supported the tenants wishes on setting up this new group. The Alliance meets on average once a month, at different venues through­out Hulme, and is regularly attended by members of 4 or 5 Hulme tenants groups. We realise that we cannot represent all the tenants in Hulme and have never claimed to do so, however all meetings and events are widely publicised and are open to anyone who wishes to attend. The Alliance will offer support to any individual tenants group who asks for it, as demonstrated in recent months by Alliance members attending various Aquarius T.A. meetings with the Hulme Project Team to discuss the proposed redevelopment of Hulme 3. Since the Alliance was formed it has been involved in many campaigns of major importance to Hulme"
