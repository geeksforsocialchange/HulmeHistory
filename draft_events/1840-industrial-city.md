In Hulme many of these workers lived in cheap back-to-back terrace housing with the population rising 50-fold from the late 18th to mid-19th century.

Hulme was also described by Engels: "the more thickly built-up regions chiefly bad and approaching ruin, the less populous of more modern structure, but generally sunk in filth" (Conditions of the Working Classes).

The industries are varied, including iron works, cotton mills, saw mills, and printing works.

Hulme obtained a Police Act in 1824. It was included within the municipal borough of Manchester in 1838 by the first charter, and then divided into two wardsâ€”St. George's on the west and Medlock Street on the east. In 1896 its independent existence ceased, it being merged in the new township of South Manchester.

The old Chorlton Union Workhouse, built about 1840, stood in Stretford Road, opposite Holy Trinity Church. This was demolished in 1860 because it was no longer adequate and Leaf Street Baths were built on this site.
